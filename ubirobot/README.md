### Brief

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular
direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the
testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which
direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream
  of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.


## Setup

Install assignment dependencies:
p
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ npm test
```

### Evaluation Criteria

- JavaScript best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
